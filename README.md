Codebase for Alexa Skill.

Currently this skill is still in beta testing.
It is written in node.js and uploaded to our aws server for testing. 

If you need access to the beta test group please contact Jeffery Dunster
at dunsterj@byui.edu for access and information on current beta testing 
instructions. 

We hope that this will be able to successfully help the University diseminate 
infomation to students and their families. As well as make information increasingly
more accessable.

This is a joint project with our Google assistant development that has the same goals
and forecasted outcomes.
