Amazon Alexa for BYU-Idaho
==========================
Welcome to the wonderful world of voice assistants! This new technology  
has the ability to transform the way that infomation is dispursed on campus.  
This is a collaborative project between the _IT_ and _University Relations_   
departments.  

## Basic Information
It is written in node.js and uploaded to our aws server for testing. Currently  
Alexa is running on a headless server with a Lambda function connected to our   
Alexa skill in the developer console.   

## Access to Beta Testing
Currently this skill is still in beta testing and not available to the pubilc.  
If you need access to the beta test group please contact Jeffery Dunster  
at **dunsterj@byui.edu** for access and information on current beta testing   
instructions.   

## Purpose
We hope that this will be able to successfully help the University diseminate   
infomation to students and their families. As well as make information increasingly  
more accessable.  

This is a joint project with our Google assistant development that has the same goals  
and forecasted outcomes.
